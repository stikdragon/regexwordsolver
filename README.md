Solver for http://regexcrossword.com/

At the moment it's quite rudimentary, basically attempts a brute-force solution
but with some intelligence to limit the set of characters that could go in each
cell.  Currently works for the easy ones, but not for the more complicated ones,
in particular it can't solve a single one of the Hamlet series.  There's an 
example output in the text file "ExampleOutput.txt".  I've starred out the answers
to prevent casual spoilering :P
